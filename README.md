\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Code test\
\
As a quick test we would like you to create a small section of a static page using the attached design 
\i (home-desktop-mockup.jpg)
\i0  and assets. We have only provided a desktop version so feel free to make any changes you see fit for a responsive layout. Feel free to elaborate on the design and add any animations etc however this isn\'92t at all required.\
\
Feel free to build using any tools/frameworks you see fit, it would be handy to include a readme if there are any steps required to run locally.\
\
## Criteria\
\
- Hero section should fill screen on load\
- Hero bg image should be fixed position when scrolled\
- Page should respond gracefully on mobile\
- Should conform to style guide\
- Assets should be optimised\
