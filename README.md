# Bolser Frontend Code Test

As a quick test we would like you to create a small section of a static page using the attached design *(home-desktop-mockup.jpg)* and assets. We have only provided a desktop version so feel free to make any changes you see fit for a responsive layout. Feel free to elaborate on the design and add any animations etc however this isn't at all required.

Feel free to build using any tools/frameworks you see fit, it would be handy to include a readme if there are any steps required to run locally.

## Criteria

- Hero section should fill screen on load
- Hero bg image should be fixed position when scrolled
- Page should respond gracefully on mobile
- Should conform to style guide
- Assets should be optimised
